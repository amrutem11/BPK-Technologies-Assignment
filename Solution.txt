To solve this question we will have to create two tables - Students and Marks.

First we wil create the table named Students, which will contain the basic information of students like first name,last name,dob,etc. To create this table we will run this query - 
	
	CREATE TABLE Students (
    roll_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(20),
    last_name VARCHAR(20),
    standard INT,
    CHECK (standard BETWEEN 1 AND 8)
    dob DATE,
    parent_name VARCHAR(40),
    address VARCHAR(100),
    city VARCHAR(20),
    phone_number VARCHAR(10),
    
);

This will create the table named student which will contain all the details of the students.
We are using CHECK constraint here to restrict the entries of standard column outside of 1 to 8 in database.

Now we will add the student entries in this students table using following query - 

INSERT INTO Students (roll_no, first_name, last_name, standard, dob, parent_name, address, city, phone_number)
VALUES (11,'Amol', 'Rahi', 6, '1998-11-15', 'Sagar Rahi', ‘Om Shanti Apartment’, 'Pune', '9876543210');



Next we will create the table named Marks which will contain students marks in all the subjects which they are studying.
 
Query - 
	CREATE TABLE Marks (
    roll_no INT,
    subject_name VARCHAR(20),
    marks_obtained INT,
    total_marks INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (roll_no) REFERENCES students(roll_no)
);

Here we are using roll_no column as a foreign key to establish the relation between students and  marks table to set the marks of each student.
Now to add the student’s marks in the marks table using following query - 

INSERT INTO Marks (roll_no, subject_name, marks_obtained, total_marks)
VALUES (11, 'Physics’', 78, 100);





Now to show all the students who have scored more than 60% - 

 We will use this query - 

SELECT s.roll_no, s.first_name, s.last_name, s.standard, m.subject_name, SUM(m.marks_obtained) AS marksObtained ,SUM( m.total_marks) AS total
FROM Students s
JOIN Marks m ON s.roll_no = m.roll_no
WHERE (SUM(m.marks_obtained) / SUM( m.total_marks)) * 100 > 60;

This query will fetch the details of all the students who have scored marks more than 60%.
